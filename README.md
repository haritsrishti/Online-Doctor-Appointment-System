# Online-Doctor-Appointment-System

## 1. Introduction
Health is the most important aspect of a personâ€™s life, and medical emergencies can arise at any moment. This web application facilitates the process of booking an appointment with a doctor online. Patients can register, view available doctors, book appointments, and even pay for consultations. Similarly, doctors can register and manage their appointments. The system also handles appointment cancellations and notifications in case of slot availability.

## 2. Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to build an online system where patients can book appointments with doctors based on their specialty, availability, and other criteria. The system must also allow doctors to manage their appointments and consultation history. Additionally, a payment gateway will be integrated for consultation charges.

## 3. Features and Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Doctor Registration Portal:
Doctors can register with details like name, specialty, and years of experience.

2. Patient Registration Portal:
Patients can register with their personal details.

3. Appointment Booking:
Patients can book appointments with doctors based on their availability.

4. Appointment Limit:
Doctors can accept a maximum of 30 appointments.

5. Cancellation and Notification:
Patients can cancel appointments at least 2 days before the consultation date.
Notification is sent to patients when a canceled appointment slot becomes available.

6. Payment System:
Patients must pay a consultation fee while booking an appointment.

7. Rescheduling:
Doctors can reschedule or cancel appointments and notify the patients.

8. Consultation History:
Both patients and doctors can maintain a history of consultations.

### Non-Functional Requirements

* Security: Ensure that user data is protected, and the payment system is secure.

* Scalability: The system should handle a growing number of users efficiently.

* Performance: The system should respond quickly to booking, cancellation, and notification requests.

## 4. Technology Stack

Backend:
* Java, Spring Boot (JPA, MVC)
* Spring Security (for authentication)

Database:
* MySQL

Cloud:
* AWS for hosting

Payment Gateway:
* Stripe, Razorpay

Version Control:
* GitHub (for code management)

## 5. System Architecture
### Architecture Overview
The system follows an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, where:

* Model: Represents the application data (entities like Doctor, Patient, Appointment).
* View: Represents the presentation layer (optional, if you use UI).
* Controller: Handles the interaction between the user interface and the backend (via REST APIs).

The project also follows a service-oriented design, where different services (e.g., AppointmentService, DoctorService) handle specific functionalities.

## System Components
### User Management:
DoctorController: Manages doctor registration and appointment schedules.
PatientController: Manages patient registration and appointment bookings.

### Appointment Management:
AppointmentController: Handles all appointment-related functionalities, such as booking, cancellation, and notifications.
Notification Service: Sends email notifications to patients regarding appointment availability.

### Payment Processing:
PaymentController: Processes payment for appointments using a third-party payment gateway.

### Database Layer:
JPA entities for managing persistent data (Doctor, Patient, Appointment, etc.).

### Security:
Spring Security is used for user authentication and authorization.

## 6. High-Level Design (HLD)
The High-Level Design provides an overview of the application's major components and their interactions.

### Components:
* User Interface (UI): Allows patients and doctors to interact with the system. (Optional if using API-based approach).
* RESTful APIs: Provides endpoints for managing appointments, payments, and notifications.
* Database: Stores all data related to doctors, patients, appointments, and payment details.

## 7. Low-Level Design (LLD)
The Low-Level Design includes the detailed structure of the classes, methods, and modules that will be implemented.
